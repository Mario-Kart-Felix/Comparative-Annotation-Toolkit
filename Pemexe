Updating electron's update server value with an app update
github electron auto-update electron-updater
I have a privately distributed app in electron, which uses my own git account (private repository) for update purposes.

I'm using GH_TOKEN.txt and this method;

autoUpdater.setFeedURL({
  provider: 'github',
  repo: '****',
  owner: '****',
  private: true,
  token: "****"
})
Now I would like to change this update server to another GitHub account, but I need to update the previous repo with this update so for the next update all the apps installed can use new one in the future.

I publish updates from the terminal, how can I publish a package to a server with a different update server?

I published to a new GitHub account then downloaded files and uploaded to previous update server manually.

Although log output is like below not looking fantastic, but it seems to be working.

This is an issue that both block maps are coming the same and hence it will fallback to the full download. I'm facing the same issue. – Aashutosh Rathi Aug 18 '20 at 9:30
